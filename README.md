# Voting-Blockchain-Website
A decentralized voting application using React JS and Solidity smart contracts.

Overview
Decentralized applications (DApps) leverage blockchain technology to provide transparency, security, and immutability. Harness the power of Ethereum, a leading blockchain platform, to create a decentralized voting system.

Topics Covered
Creating Solidity Smart Contracts: Write smart contracts in Solidity, Ethereum's programming language, to handle the voting logic.
Setting Up Ethereum Network: Configure our development environment to interact with the Ethereum blockchain using tools like Hardhat or Truffle.
Building Front-End with React JS:Design and implement the user interface for our voting application using React JS.
Interacting with Smart Contracts: Connect the front-end React application to the Ethereum blockchain and interact with the deployed smart contracts.
